In a `Tree`, the running time for most operations is __O(logN)__

## 4.1 Preliminaries
 - A `tree` can be defined in several ways. One natural way to define a tree is __recursively__.
- A `tree` is a collection of _nodes_.
- If not empty, a `tree` consists of a distinguished node _r_, called the __root__, and zero or more nonempty (sub)trees _T1_, _T2_, .... , _Tk_, each of whose roots are connected by a directed _edge_ from _r_
- The _root_ of each subtree is said to be a __child__ of _r_, and _r_ is the parent of each subtree root.

### 4.1.1 Implementation of Trees
The solution is simple:
    Keep the children of each node in a linked list of tree nodes.
```c
#define ElementType int
typedef struct TreeNode* PtrToNode;

struct TreeNode
{
	ElementType Element;
	PtrToNode FirstChild;
	PtrToNode NextSibling;
};
``` 
`FirstChild` points to the head of its child 
`NextSibling` points to its brother in the linked list

### 4.1.2 Tree Traversals with an Application
The structure of a Unix file system.
`/usr`
__Codes to imply this idea:__
```c
static void ListDir( DirectoryOrFile D, int Depth )
{
	if (D is a legitimate entry)
	{
		PrintName(D, Depth);
		if (D is an directory )
		{
			for each child, C of D
				ListDir(C, Depth+1);
		}
	}
}

void ListDirectory( DirectoryOrFile D )
{
	ListDir(D, 0);
}

static void SizeOfDirectory( DirectoryOrFile D )
{
    int TotalSize;
    
    TotalSize = 0;
    if( D is a legitimate entry )
    {
        TotalSize = FileSize( D );
        if( D is a directory )
            for each child C of D
                TotalSize += SizeOfDirectory( C );
    }
    return TotalSize;
}
```

## 4.2 Binary Trees 
A binary tree is a tree in which no node can have more than two children.
### 4.2.1 Implementation
- Because a binary tree has most two children, we can keep direct pointers to them.
- In that a node is a structure consists of the _Key_ information plus two pointers (`left` and `right`) to other nodes.

```c
typedef struct TreeNode* PtrToNode;
typedef struct PtrToNode Tree;

struct TreeNode
{
	ElementType Element;
	Tree Left;
	Tree Right;
};
```

### 4.2.2 Expression Trees
![tree](/assets/img/exp-tree.svg)
We can produce an (overly parenthesized) infix expression by recursively producing a parenthesized left expression, then print out the operator at the root, and finally recursively producing a right parenthesized expression.

This general strategy is known as an _inorder_ traversal; it is easy to remember because of the type of expression it produces.

There are two alternative strategies. See the book for more examples.

#### Constructing an Expression Tree
We now give an algorithm to convert a postfix expression into an expression tree.
As an example, suppose the input is:
    `a b + c d e + * *`
Codes can be found [here](https://github.com/hellobbn/C-Program/tree/master/C-Programs/P-8).

## 4.3 AVL Tree
An `AVL` tree is a search tree with a *balance* condition.
- Require the left and right subtrees have the same height 
- Every node must have left and right trees with the same height.

An `AVL` tree is identical to a binary search tree, except that for every node in the tree, the height of the left and right subtrees can differ at most 1. (The height of a empty tree is defined to be `-1`)

__Figure: A AVL tree__

__Note: Balanced factor__ (Wikipedia)
In a binary tree the balance factor of a node N is defined to be the height difference

    BalanceFactor(N) := Height(RightSubtree(N)) – Height(LeftSubtree(N))

of its two child subtrees. A binary tree is defined to be an AVL tree if the invariant

    BalanceFactor(N) ∈ {–1,0,+1}

holds for every node N in the tree.

A node N with BalanceFactor(N) < 0 is called "left-heavy", one with BalanceFactor(N) > 0 is called "right-heavy", and one with BalanceFactor(N) = 0 is sometimes simply called "balanced".
             
              
               
               
The minimum number of nodes, _S(h)_ , in an `AVL` tree of height __h__ is given by

    S(h) = S(h-1) + S(h-2) + 1 


- Thus, all the tree operations can be performed in __O($$log(N)$$)__ time, except possibly insertion( we will assume lazy deletion ). When we do a insertion, we need to update all the balancing information for the nodes on the path back to the `root`, but the reason that insertion is potentially difficult is that inserting a node could violate the `AVL` Tree property.
- If this is the case, then the property has to be resorted before the insertion step is considered over. It turns out that this can always be done with a simple modification to the tree, known as a __rotation__
- After insertion, only nodes that are on the path from the insertion point to the root might have their balance altered because only those nodes have their subtrees altered. 
- As we follow the path up to the root and update the balancing information, we may find a node whose new balance violates the `AVL` condition.

Lets call the node that must be rebalanced $${\alpha}$$. Since any node has at most two children, and a height imbalance requires that $${\alpha}$$'s two subtrees' height differ by two, it is easy to see that a violation might occur in four cases:
1. An insertion into the left subtree of the left child of $${\alpha}$$;
2. An insertion into the right subtree of the left child of $${\alpha}$$.
3. An insertion into the left subtree of the right child of $${\alpha}$$.
4. An insertion into the left subtree of the right child of $${\alpha}$$.

The first case (`left-left` `right-right`) is fixed by a _single rotation_ of the tree and the second case (`left-right` `right-left`) is handled by a more complex _double rotation_.
